# we need to use __init__.py to follow the PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal) standard
# although we can name it how ever we want like init.py init_py.py but we can use __init__ to 
# make sure that we follow the standard. Also we are not allowed to use capitalized names
from .utils import sample_function # we import the sample_function in utils files using relative paths
